            <li style="background-color: lightpink;"><p><a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/windows-commands">Windows commands</a><br />
            This website shows the Windows command for the command prompt. Very useful commands with the cmder. 
            It is vaulable as a quick reference for people who are using the command line to do literally anything.
            It will be useful in my career because using the command line is a skill that is needed and can be easily learned. Having this skill will help in parallel to using Github, and other programs. It is also useful when using command lines in VMs or nondisplay VMs.<br />

            <li style="background-color: lightpink;"><p><a href="https://slashdot.org/">Slashdot</a><br />
            This website is up to date with all things related to technologies.
            This website is important because as developers, we need to stay up to date with all technology news and programming. 
            This will allow us to keep our code up to date or check what is going on with other companies.
            This is useful in our careers because again, keeping up with the news can be difficult but this site is geared more for developers then anyone else.

            <li style="background-color: lightpink;"><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stackoverflow</a><br />
            This is the heart of a developer. 
            The most popular site for a developer that literally has every answer to any question you may have.
            This will be very useful and is useful currently for quick answers. I mainly use it when I have errors in my code that I don't understand.<br />

            <li style="background-color: lightpink;"><p><a href="https://devdocs.io/">DevDocs</a><br />
            This incredible resource has all the information for literally every language you could imagine. 
            This is incredible important because all the information you need about any language or syntax help is in the same location with a handy search bar.
            The resource is valuable to web developers and ios and android developers alike. Definitly valuable to current and future full stack developers.            
            This resource will be very useful in my career because while Google can show the same information, this is all on one website in a easy to read format with a search bar that can get you where you are going quickly.

            <li style="background-color: lightpink;"><p><a href="https://www.w3.org/standards/webdesign/">W3C</a><br />
            W3C is the standard for all things CSS and designing standards. 
            This is very useful for all developers when they eventually come to the design part of their website.
            It will be useful in my career because it literally has the design standards that websites use and follow to make sure their websites are using elements properly.
            Text description of what information the resource contains, why it is important or valuable, to whom is it vaulable,
            to whom is it valuable, and how you will use it in your career.<br />
