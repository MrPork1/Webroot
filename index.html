          <p>Ever since middle school, I've been learnimg more and more and computer and programming and software development. My first class was basic computer keyboard games back in 7th grade. I wasn't a fan of that class because it just constant keyboard games and it wasn't very fun at the time. Once I was in high school though, I took robotics class and software and creating LEGO robots that followed the code that you wrote. For our final project, we had to make the robot turn in a 360 degree loop 20 times and then go straight for 5 seconds. For a highschooler, this was quite fun especially in a group setting.</p>
          <p>I know C# the best, with dabbling in Pyhton and Java and Javascript. I use Unity to create small games and those are written in C#. I am glad that the Application Development track is using C# because I know C#.</p>
          <p>Coca-Cola vs Pepsi has been a huge debate in America for centures, and could be the biggest issue in this country. Lots of variables, including bubble amount, and the grams of sugar all lead to an epic showdown between these two legendary brands.</p>
          <p>I got a small dog last year, and he is quite the handful. I called him Ghost, as he was shy. But turned out he loves to bark, so he is the exact opposite of a Ghost, so that kind of backfired.</p>
